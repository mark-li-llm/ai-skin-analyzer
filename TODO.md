## üî• Now

### MVP Implementation (Ready to Start üöÄ)

**All Prerequisites Complete**:
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API validated (gpt-5-nano, production-ready prompt)
- ‚úÖ Technical decisions finalized (ADR-004, 005, 006)
- ‚úÖ sharp verified on Vercel (performance excellent)
- ‚úÖ API contract documented (CONTRACT-001-MVP.md)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript types defined (types/analysis.ts)
- ‚úÖ Mock data created (public/mocks/)
- ‚úÖ Documentation architecture cleaned up

**Ready for Parallel Development**:
- Frontend can use mock data (public/mocks/)
- Backend can implement API route with verified libraries
- Both can work independently following CONTRACT-001-MVP.md

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next

### Immediate Tasks (This Week)

**Documentation Updates**:
- [ ] Update ADR-005 status from "Proposed" to "Accepted"
- [ ] Supplement mock data (add more skin type variants)
- [ ] Create DEV_SETUP.md for onboarding

**Frontend Tasks** (see [SPRINT-001](docs/SPRINT-001-MVP.md)):
- [ ] Create landing page with image upload component
- [ ] Build upload component (drag/drop, validation, disclaimers)
- [ ] Create results display component (3-part layout)
- [ ] Implement error handling UI

**Backend Tasks** (see [SPRINT-001](docs/SPRINT-001-MVP.md)):
- [ ] Build `/api/analyze-skin` API route
- [ ] Implement file upload handling (FormData)
- [ ] Add image preprocessing (sharp: resize, format, base64)
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI Vision API call
- [ ] Add error handling and validation

**Integration**:
- [ ] Connect frontend to real API
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Vercel deployment

## üî¨ Questions / Blockers

- None currently

## üí° Ideas

- Consider adding image quality feedback (too dark, too blurry, etc.)
- Could add "retake photo" guidance for low confidence results
- Future: multi-language support for international markets
