# SPRINT-001 — MVP Parallel Development Checklist (Minimum Implementation)

## Goals & Scope (Extracted from PRD)
- **Deliverable**: Single facial photo upload → AI analysis → Three-part results display:
  - Skin type (oily/dry/combination/normal/sensitive) + confidence score
  - Sunscreen formulation type + reasoning
  - 1-2 specific sunscreen products (brand/name/SPF/key benefits)
- **Not Included**: User accounts, database/persistence, history, other product categories, sharing/payment

**References**: `docs/01-prd.md` (Core Features), `docs/02-technical-spec.md:99` (Success Criteria)

## Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
- [x] Can upload jpg/jpeg/png, single file ≤ 5MB
- [x] Successfully send analysis request to backend and receive valid JSON (fields below)
- [x] UI fully renders three-part results (with confidence and specific products)
- [x] Common errors have clear prompts (size exceeded/unsupported type/analysis failure)

## API Contract Summary
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/analyze-skin`
- **Request Body**: `multipart/form-data`, field name `file`, only `jpg|jpeg|png`, ≤ 5MB
- **Success Response Fields**:
  - `skinType`, `confidence`
  - `analysis.observedCharacteristics[]`, `analysis.skinTypeExplanation`
  - `productRecommendation.formulationType`, `formulationReasoning`
  - `productRecommendation.specificProducts[1..2]` (`brandName`/`productName`/`spf`/`keyBenefit`)
  - `additionalNotes?`
- **Error Response**: `{ "error": "InvalidImage|FileTooLarge|UnsupportedType|APIError" }`

(Detailed fields in `docs/02-technical-spec.md` and shared types `types/analysis.ts`)

## Frontend Tasks (Minimum)
- [x] Upload component: File selection/drag-and-drop, type and ≤5MB validation, submit/loading state/retry
- [x] Disclaimer display (medical/product/AI) before allowing upload (see `legal/disclaimers.md`)
- [x] API call: Handle success/failure/low confidence states
- [x] Results display: Three-part layout + product cards; mobile responsive

## Backend Tasks (Minimum)
- [x] API route `POST /api/analyze-skin` (App Router)
- [x] Validation: MIME and size (400/413/415), missing file error (400)
- [x] Image preprocessing: Proportional resize to ≤1024×1024 (no stretching, no upscaling, JPEG 85-90%)
- [x] AI call: `gpt-5-nano`, `detail: "high"`, `max_completion_tokens`, 60s timeout
- [x] Response validation: Ensure returned JSON conforms to contract; failures mapped to 500 (`APIError`)

## Parallel Development Sequence (Lightweight)
1) **Freeze contract**: Use `types/analysis.ts` as single source of truth (if changes needed, sync this doc and mocks)
2) **Frontend uses fixed mock JSON** to develop results page; backend returns fixed fake data to establish request flow
3) **Backend integrates real AI**; frontend switches to real API
4) **End-to-end manual testing** passes all four "Acceptance Criteria" items before merging

## Example (Success)
```json
{
  "skinType": "combination",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "analysis": {
    "observedCharacteristics": ["Slight oiliness in T-zone", "Both cheeks relatively balanced"],
    "skinTypeExplanation": "T-zone shows more sebum secretion while cheeks are more balanced, classified as combination skin"
  },
  "productRecommendation": {
    "formulationType": "Lightweight oil-control gel",
    "formulationReasoning": "Balances T-zone oil control with lightweight protection for cheeks",
    "specificProducts": [
      {"brandName":"Neutrogena","productName":"Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch","spf":"55","keyBenefit":"Lightweight, non-greasy, oil control"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Example (Failure)
```json
{ "error": "FileTooLarge" }
```
